# CodeSamples

  In this repository, I attached 2 of my contributions to creating Affordable South LA's page with Code the Change and a final research report I wrote after a summer and a semester as a research assistant at Professor Lien's lab. 

  With Node.js, I created a FormQuestion model to take in each attribute of id, question, responseType, and options and routes to add, delete, and update each FormQuestion object depending on if each action is valid.

  Using React, I created an info box component displaying our users' responses to our forms. With flexbox and a scroll feature, each question and answer pair would be displayed on the component with neat formatting and adapt to both mobile and larger platforms.

  Right now I feel the most confident coding in C++, JavaScript and am currently learning java with csci201, I look forward to learning python soon for its versatility in academic research.
